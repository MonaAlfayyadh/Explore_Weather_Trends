## Abstract

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in Riyadh to overall global temperature trends. I extracted the data from a database then exported to .CSV
Then the data has been analyzed using Excel to calculate a moving to smooth out data and observe the trends in temperature to get the best visualized line chart. Finally, I made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my cityâ€™s averages.
